# ML-SIG  2019: lecture 1 [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/coolsidd/ML_SIG_2019_Lecture/master)
The first in a series of lectures on Machine Learning organized by BITS-ACM. This was an introductory lecture that introduced people to the world of Machine Learning.
The focus was on developing people's interest in ML rather than teaching them about the code. As a result, instead of a presentation , An interactive jupyter notebook was used. (accessible from the binder link given above)
## Topics covered
* Introduction - definition of Machine Learning
* Introduction to linear regression
* Extending linear regression - polynomial regression.
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Visualizing clustering algorithms
